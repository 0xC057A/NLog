    <p style="color: red"><b>Caution:</b> This website reflects the logging API and configuration file format
        of NLog 0.9. For information on previous versions see the archived website <a href="http://nlog.sourceforge.net/old/">here</a>.</p>

                <p>NLog 0.9 has been released!</p>

                <p>Major changes:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><b>API redesign/rename.</b></li>
                    <p>"Appender" has been renamed as "Target" and 
                        "LayoutAppender" as "LayoutRenderer". This should make it easier for 
                        people to understand the basic concepts ("layout appender" wasn't a good 
                        idea). Old configuration file format is still supported. Old extension code 
                        should require nothing more than a search/replace and a recompile.
                    </p>
                    <li>
                        Improved logging and non-logging speed by removing most abstraction
                        from the Logger class.
                    </li>
                    <p>
                        A single non-logging operation takes only 7 
                        nanoseconds which means 140.000.000 logs/second). Logging API should remain 
                        the same.
                    </p>
                    <li>
                        Changed the way the configuration file is parsed. Now elements are 
                        processed top-down and you can change the order of the sections as well as 
                        the elements you reference have been processed before. 
                    </li>
                </ol> 

                <p>Bugs fixed:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Fixed an old bug where appenders were incorrectly combined into a chain.</li>
                </ol>

                <p>New additions:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Network target (capable of sending messages over TCP and UDP, HTTP to be 
                        supported)</li>
                    <li>Preliminary NLogViewer target and a sketchy, but already usable viewer 
                        application. "Chainsaw" target should probably be added as well.</li>
                    <li>Added LogManager.GlobalThreshold</li>
                    <li>API documentation, target, layout renderer and filter documentation is 
                        generated from source code comments using NDoc.</li>
                    <li>100% of public methods are commented in the source code.</li>
                    <li>Reworked the tutorial and howtos</li>
                    <li>Reworked the website.</li>
                </ol>
