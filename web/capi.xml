    <h1>C/C++ API</h1>
    <p>
        NLog supports a C/C++ logging API that can be used in scenarios that require the use 
        of C/C++ components in .NET projects. Typical case is porting a legacy systen to .NET
        where some parts are rewritten in managed code while some remain unmanaged.
    </p>
    <p>
        This API is available through <code>NLogC.dll</code> which is a mixed-mode (managed/unmanaged) 
        assembly. It provides the following set exported functions:
    </p>

    <cs src="examples/NLogC.cpp" />

    <p>
        For your convenience, the following defines which use a <code>TCHAR</code> data type are available:
    </p>
    
    <cs src="examples/NLogCdef.cpp" />

    <p>
        Here's the short summary of what these functions do:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li><code>NLog_ConfigureFromFile(filename)</code></li>
        <p>
            Configures NLog from the specified config file. You should call this function at the beginning of your
            program if you want to specify your own config file. If you don't do this, NLog will attempt to find
            the config file the first time you use any of the logging functions using the logic described <link href="config">here</link>.
        </p>
    </ul>
