2006-02-14 Jaroslaw Kowalski <jaak@jkowalski.net>
	* Updated license and email addresses.
	* Updated assembly version and description for 0.95 release.

2006-02-13 Yuri Mamrukov <yvm@att.net>

	* Patch to simplify InternalLogger configuration from environment
	variables and/or App.config settings. Fixes some nasty bug here.

2006-02-13 Jaroslaw Kowalski <jaak@jkowalski.net>

	* Added some docs, moving website to http://www.nlog-project.org/
	* Excluded NLogViewer from build and project.
	* Refactored LoggerImpl to allow for some extensibility in the future.

2006-01-13 Jaroslaw Kowalski <jaak@jkowalski.net>

	* Fixed a serious reentrancy bug which caused all sorts of problems
	when formatted message included a parameter where ToString
	did the logging itself.

2005-10-26 Jaroslaw Kowalski <jaak@jkowalski.net>

	* Added ${aspnet-sessionid} to access (guess!) ASP.NET session ID

2005-10-25 Jaroslaw Kowalski <jaak@jkowalski.net>

	* Added ASPNetBufferingWrapper target which buffers and post-processes
	the entire ASP.NET request (requires you to use the NLogHttpModule)
	* Added PostFilteringWrapper target which is able to filter log events
	based on a buffer as a whole. It is possible for example to dump the
	detailed ( >= Trace level) trace of a request if there was at least 
	one >= Warn event in the buffer, but under normal conditions only output
	the >= Info levels.
	* Reworked the way the documentation is generated (we no longer use
	ugly IFRAMEs and the same method is used to generate the website and
	the docs)
	* Added a new conditions language (see conditions.html for more
	information) which let you write powerful   filtering conditions 
	while keeping the syntax natural and readable
	* Added <when condition="..." action="..." /> filter which uses condition
	expressions
	* Added examples for the MailTarget and BufferedMailTarget
	* Fixed Close() behaviour for unnamed targets (like the ones configured
	by SimpleConfigurator)
	* Added some more documentation (still some work to do before the release)
	* Fixed the example for asynchronous Tile target (async="true" is not 
	supported and is replaced by the AsyncWrapper target)

2005-10-21 Jaroslaw Kowalski <jaak@jkowalski.net>

	* Added ${processname}, ${processid} layout renderers
	* Added GDC (Global Diagnostics Context) and ${gdc} layout renderer which
	is a global (as opposed to per-thread) version of MDC and ${mdc}

2005-10-11 Jaroslaw Kowalski <jaak@jkowalski.net>

	* Refactored NLogViewer by separating NLogViewer.Interfaces
	* Added NLogViewer.NDumbsterSmtpReceiver (by Ron Grabowski)
	* Added support for caching layout results per logEvent which
	makes them transportable across threads
	* Renamed Target.Append() method to Write() (how did I forget it?)
	* Added Target.Write(LogEvent[] manyEvents) for cases where the
	target can optimize group writes
	* Added Log4JXmlEvent.cs
	* Added Wrappers: AsyncWrapper, AutoFlushWrapper, BufferingWrapper, 
	RepeatingWrapper, RetryingWrapper
	* Some preliminary work on request buffering wrappers. 
	* Added compound targets (fallback, randomize, roundrobin, split)
    * WARNING: This requires some serious testing.
