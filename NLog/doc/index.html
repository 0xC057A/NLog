                    designed with simplicity and flexibility in mind. NLog project is hosted at <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/nlog">sourceforge.net</a>.
                    </p>

                        <li>very easy to configure, both with a config file and programmatically</li>

                    <h3>News</h3>

                    <p><span class="newsdate">2004-09-28</span> Improved support for .NETCF and added MessageBoxAppender. Also added the new .NETCF binary snapshot. You can get the new version from the <a href="snapshots/">snapshots</a> directory.</p>
                    <p><span class="newsdate">2004-09-02</span> Added preliminary support for database logging. It's available in SVN repository or in the <a href="snapshots/">snapshots</a>.</p>
                    <p><span class="newsdate">2004-08-30</span> <font color="red"><b>NLog 0.2 beta 1 has been released!!!</b></font>. This is the initial public release and includes source and binary package plus a Win32-based graphical <a href="http://nsis.sourceforge.net/">installer</a> which is a one-click way to install NLog for use with VS.NET. Download it <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=116456">here</a>.</p>
                    <p><span class="newsdate">2004-08-26</span> Added OutputDebugString appender.</p>
                    <p><span class="newsdate">2004-08-25</span> First API stabilization attempt. Introduced typed collection for almost all public properties. The logging interface is now clean and very unlikely to change in the future. Programmatic configuration API may see some revisions, but don't expect them to be major.</p>

                    is feature complete now. Future work will concentrate on stabilizing things and adding new appenders, layout appenders 
                    and filters.</p>
                    <p><span class="newsdate">2004-08-21</span> Public announcement of the NLog project.</p>

                    <h3>Current Status</h3>
                    <p>
                    NLog 0.2 beta1 has been released in source and binary form. It's open source, licensed 
                    under the terms of <a href="http://www.opensource.org/licenses/bsd-license.php">BSD license</a>, 
                    which permits commercial use. Everyone is encouraged to test it and report feedback to the mailing list.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    The logging API is really minimal and shouldn't change in the future. Configuration API isn't ready yet, but 
                    the configuration file support should be pretty usable. The support for .NET CF is in subversion but no packages
                    are available yet. They will be, when it receives some testing and positive feedback from the community.
                    </p>
