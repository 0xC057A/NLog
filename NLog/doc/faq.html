        <a name="#whatis"><h4>What is NLog?</h4>
        <p>
        NLog is a simple logging library similar in concepts to <a href="http://log4net.sourceforge.net/">log4net</a>, 
        designed with simplicity and flexibility in mind.

        <a name="#why"><h4>Why should I use NLog? Why not log4net?</h4>
        <p>
        There are many logging libraries out there, <a href="http://log4net.sourceforge.net/">log4net</a> 
        being one of them.</p>
        <p>Most people I know have problems using log4net because it's difficult configure properly. 
        Log4net's usage is also complicated because its logging interface doesn't take advantage of 
        .NET features like functions with variable number of arguments. Also log4net is not very portable - there are
        many framework-specific versions of the library (one for .NET 1.0, onet for .NET 1.1, one for Mono, and so on)
        which makes binary portability difficult.</p>
        <p>NLog is an answer to all these shortcomings: it's easy to configure, easy to use, easy to extend 
        and portable across frameworks.</p>
